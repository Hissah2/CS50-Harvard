## My personal opinion

Thank God, I finished a course of the most enjoyable and enriched courses that I have entered in my life, especially the quality of the content of sound, image, order and clarity required in duties and projects. I must mention the main reason that motivated me to finish the course in record time, which is Professor David Malan, I mean, it is normal, a lecture of two hours

## Some of the personal projects

1- Finance

A fake site where shares are bought with a fake balance of 10,000 with the possibility of adding money and buying and selling shares and appearing in history as a table.

2- Birthday

A site to register the days of birth, friends or family.

3- Blog& Service

A personal blog with a forum work service in which personal information, experiences and various projects are displayed (in development).
